# CSU11010-Introduction-to-Programming-Semester-1
This repo contains all assignment solutions that I have written for Introduction to Programming (Semester 1) in Trinity College Dublin

This module provides an introductory course in computer programming. This course takes a practical approach to teaching the fundamental concepts of computer programming with a strong emphasis on tutorial and laboratory work and is an important vehicle for developing students’ analytical and problem-solving skills. This module aims to give students an understanding of how computers can be employed to solve real-world (albeit small) problems. Specifically, this course introduces students to the imperative approach to program design and teaches them how to write programs in Java.  Specific topics addressed in this module include:

·         Types and variables including integer, floating-point and string types;

·         Sequencing, assignment and expressions;

·         Boolean expressions;

·         Selection statements: if, if-else, nested if, and switch-case;

·         Iteration statements: while, for, do-while, and nested loops;

·         Using, creating and designing methods and recursive methods;

·         Design of simple algorithms using sequencing, selection, iteration and methods;

·         Arrays including higher dimensional arrays
