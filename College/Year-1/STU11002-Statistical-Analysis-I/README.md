This repo contains all my lab tasks for Statistical Analysis in Trinity College Dublin

The aim of the course is to introduce the students to basic statistical concepts. In this module students will learn how to explain basic statistical theory and apply the techniques to data. Students will be able to describe and interpret the results of their analyses in a detailed fashion. R Studio will be used to analyze data.
