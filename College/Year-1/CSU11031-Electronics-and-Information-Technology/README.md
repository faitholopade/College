# CSU11031-Electronics-and-Information-Technology
This repo contains all my lab solutions for Electronics and Information Technology in Trinity College Dublin

Part I: Electronics
The first aim of the first part of this module is to give students a grounding in electronics. To this end we will examine the fundamental circuit components and evaluate circuits built using these components using a circuit simulator. The second aim of the first part of the module is that students be able to explain the concepts of wireless communications at the physical layer. This includes an explanation of
electromagnetic fields (the means), the antenna (the front end transmit/receive device) and the means by which EM signals can be modulated to transmit information.


Part II: Information Technology
The second part of the module begins with an overview of the concept of information and its significance in todaysâ€™ society. The aim of the module is to then show how such information is transmitted over links and networks. The course gives particular focus on the understanding of time domain, frequency domain and bandwidth of signals. It introduces some basic operations, such as modulation and multiplexing, and will introduce some general concepts of data transmission and transmission media. Course work will consist of assignments that will put in practice most of the theory explained during the lectures and tutorials.
