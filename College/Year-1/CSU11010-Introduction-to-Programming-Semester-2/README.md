# CSU11010-Introduction-to-Programming-Semester-2
This repo contains all assignment, etest, lecture problems and tutorial problem solutions that I have written for Introduction to Programming (Semester 2) in Trinity College Dublin

This course introduces students to the object-oriented approach to program design and teaches them how to write programs in an object-oriented language (in this case Java). Students also have the opportunity to reinforce their problem solving and programming skills by developing solutions to programming problems and implementing those solutions as object-based programs.

Specific topics addressed in this module include:

Design of simple algorithms using sequencing, selection, iteration and methods.
Arrays including higher dimensional arrays.
Using, creating and designing classes and objects including attributes and methods.
Abstraction, encapsulation and immutability in designing classes.
