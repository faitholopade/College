# CSU11026-Digital-Logic-Design-Semester-2
This repo contains all assignment solutions that I have written for Digital Logic Design (Semester 2) in Trinity College Dublin


The lectures do not assume any prior knowledge of the subject, and build gradually in difficulty towards the end of the course. Starting with the theoretical foundations of logic, the students learn about combinatorial logic and synchronous logic, and how it can be used to construct logic functions that are useful in computing systems. The focus is on laying the groundwork for the hardware courses in the second year. Care is taken that the students realize the subject applies to both computer software and hardware. Laboratory experiments reinforce the concepts as well as adding variety and introducing practical elements.
