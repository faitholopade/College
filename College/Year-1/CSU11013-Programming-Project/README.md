# CSU11013-Programming-Project
This repo contains all my weekly exercise solutions for Programming Project in Trinity College Dublin

The focus of the module is on the construction of working, interactive, graphical programs. Over the first six weeks, students will develop their programming skills through the development of programs individually, demonstrating and explaining them at laboratory sessions every week, and building up a portfolio of code submissions on the subversion version control system. Following the reading week, they will apply these skills to the development of an interactive visualization program as part of a team, with Subversion used as a means for the team to work on a shared program.
