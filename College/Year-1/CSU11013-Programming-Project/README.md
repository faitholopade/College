# CSU11013-Programming-Project
This repo contains all my weekly exercise solutions for Programming Project in Trinity College Dublin

CS1013 is a module which concentrates on development of practical programming ability through example-based lecturing coupled with intensive laboratory sessions. The emphasis throughout is on producing working programs, starting with interactive graphical applications and moving on to construction of a larger group project involving a data visualization task. The aim is to improve your programming skills, and become familiar with the challenges involved in building larger and more complex programs.
