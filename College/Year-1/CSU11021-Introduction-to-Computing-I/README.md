# CSU11021-Introduction-to-Computing-I
This repo contains all assignment, exam and exercise solutions that I have written for Introduction to Computing I (CSU11021) in Trinity College Dublin


This module provides students with an introduction to the basic structure and operation of a computer system, focussing on the processor (CPU), memory and the execution of software.

Students gain an insight into the execution of programs on a computer system by designing, implementing and executing simple assembly language programs. Students are also introduced to concepts that are fundamental to the study of Computer Science, including the binary numeral system and the representation of basic information such as signed integers and strings (text). 

Students are encouraged to consider the relationship between high-level programming language constructs – from simple assignments and arithmetic expressions to conditional (if, else) and iterative (while, for, do) execution – and the realisation of these constructs as sequences of machine instructions. Students are also given opportunities to develop their problem solving, programming and written communication skills by designing solutions to programming problems, implementing those solutions, first in the form of high-level pseudo-code programs and then as assembly language programs, which they must document and test.
